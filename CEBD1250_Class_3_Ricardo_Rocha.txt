Return all salaries that are between 40000 and 60000
mysql> SELECT * FROM salaries WHERE salary>40000 AND salary<60000;
1240948 rows in set (1.37 sec)

Select all employees hired after 01-01-1995
mysql> SELECT * FROM employees WHERE hire_date>'1995-01-01';

different to_date values
mysql> SELECT * FROM titles WHERE to_date = '9999-01-01'; ALTER TABLE titles ADD status VARCHAR(10);
240124 rows in set (0.20 sec)

Return the minimum salary of the salary table

What is the difference between “Having” and “Where” clauses?
The HAVING CLAUSE works in the results of an aggregate operation while a WHERE CLAUSE works directly at the table level.

Return the maximum value for date of birth on the employee table
mysql> SELECT MAX(birth_date) FROM employees;
+-----------------+
| MAX(birth_date) |
+-----------------+
| 1965-02-01      |
+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.12 sec)

What is wrong with the following query, re-write it making the needed corrections.
    SELECT employee.emp_no, AVG(salaries.salary)
    FROM employee INNER JOIN salaries AT employee.emp_no = salaries.emp_no
    HAVING AVG(salaries.salary) > 10000
    GROUP BY employee.emp_no
The order of HAVING CLAUSE and GROUP BY is inverted.

Write a SQL query to get the third highest salary of an employee from employee_table

Write a SQL that returns the employee name and title for all employees with even number as actual salary (to_date is 9999-01-01)

What is the difference between a relational data model and a data warehouse?

A data warehouse is used to solve business analitcs and it allows data reduncy while a normalized database works in eliminating redudancy to optimize resources.

Which are the data warehouse phases?
1) OLTP PHASE
2) STAGING PHASE
3) METADATA PHASE
4) OLAP PHASE
5) PRESENTATION PHASE

Can you list the importance of the staging phase?
The staging phase is important to:
1) Increase the efficiency of ETL processes
2) Ensure data integrity
3) Support data quality operations
